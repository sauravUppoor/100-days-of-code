* Building a basic Sign Up page with Form Validations included

#### Progress:

The form validations done by me were pretty basic but served the purpose of learning and understanding how it functions. Maybe in the fututre project would apply it in a more industry - specific manner.

#### Plan of action tomorrow:

### Day 11: Installing Babel

Lots of installations using the ```npm install```. Got to know that Babel helps to convert the JS file from one ES module to ES5 However yet doesnt really know where the real application of it lies. Hopefully will find out by the end of this course!

* Learn about form validations and build a simple Login / SignUp Page

#### Plan of action tomorrow:
* Start with #Javascript30 as everyday of the same course would be monotonous.
